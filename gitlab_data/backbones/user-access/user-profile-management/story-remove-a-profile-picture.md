# Remove a profile picture

### User Story

**As a** registered user,
**I want to** remove my current profile picture,
**So that** my account reverts to a default, generic avatar.

---

### Acceptance Criteria
*This list defines what must be true from the user's perspective for the story to be considered "done."

- [ ] A user with an existing profile picture can find a 'Remove Picture' option on their profile page.
- [ ] When the remove option is selected, the user is asked to confirm their action.
- [ ] After confirming, the custom profile picture is removed and replaced with a default system avatar (e.g., an icon with the user's initials).
- [ ] The default avatar is now visible in all relevant areas of the application where the profile picture was previously shown.
